# In silico analysis of plasticity in the pancreatic lineages

This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline used in my master's dissertation for reconstructing cell lineages and analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data from human pancreas development using CellTag, Seurat, and GEMLI.  
Raw data, metadata, and outputs are not available since there are unpublished information.

## Analyses were performed using:

- [Seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) – scRNA-seq quality control, processing, and clustering
- [CellTag](https://github.com/morris-lab/BiddyetalWorkflow.git)- CellTag-mediated lineage tracing
- [GEMLI](https://github.com/UPSUTER/GEMLI) – in silico lineage inference  
- R version 4.4.1 on macOS Sonoma 14.2.1

The full list of R packages and versions can be found in Method section of the dissertation.
